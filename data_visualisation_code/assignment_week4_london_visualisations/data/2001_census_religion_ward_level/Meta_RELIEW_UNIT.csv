Using individual religion codes
Note 1: Users need to be aware that to get a complete number of adherents to a particular religious group they may need to collapse several codes, for example Free Presbyterian and Free
Presbyterian Church of Ulster. This is due to
several factors:
a) Adherents to a particular religious group
do not always label themselves identically;
b) Lack of space required respondents to
abbreviate the full title of their religious
group. This was done in several different
ways and often resulted in a more
general term which could not accurately
be assigned to one particular religious
group; and
c) The requirement for a common England,
Wales and Northern Ireland index
meant that while in Northern Ireland
all Free Presbyterians are probably Free
Presbyterian Church of Ulster, this may
not be true in England as there may also
be adherents of the Free Presbyterian
Church of Scotland
However, users must be aware that when
collapsing codes, the two codes may not be
identical. For example, the code Presbyterian
does not only include respondents who just
wrote Presbyterian but also Presbyterian USA
and Presbyterian in NZ. Similarly, the code
United Church is probably predominately
United Church of Canada but may include other
respondents.
Note 2: Apart from making it necessary to
collapse categories, the use of abbreviations may
have resulted in several respondents (possibly
on the same form) who belong to the same
religious group having been coded differently.
This is particularly relevant to automatic coding
where there is no human intervention. Examples
include ‘Christian Fellowship Church' coded as
029. If a respondent abbreviates this as ‘Christian
Fellowship' it would be coded as 028 and if it is
abbreviated as ‘Fellowship Church' it would be
coded as 165. As ‘Christian Fellowship' includes
many other respondents apart from those
belonging to this one denomination these codes
cannot be collapsed.",
